    #### var.cond: == flux 
    ####           == pool
    #### var.col: which variable column to extract data points
    #### Compute confidence interval of the absolute values
    #### For fluxes, time should always be a factor
    #### For pools that increment over time, time doesn't have to be a factor
    #### For fluxes, calculate annual sum
    #### A few points to keep in mind:
    ####       Fluxes as daily values could result in different model statistics;
    ####       The model assumption that ring as a random variable could be removed;
    ####       Within ring variability has not been considered here, as we are reporting one value per ring per date only;
    ####       Some fluxes (e.g. CH4) have both positive and negative values - effect size using log is not a good idea;
    ####       Some variables don't have a balanced data input (e.g. SLA);
    ####       Soil C pool should possibly consider time not as a factor;
    ####       To simply look at treatment effect we probably don't need to consider interaction anyway.
