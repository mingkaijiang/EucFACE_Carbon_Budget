    ### Information to know: the life cycle of lerp is ~ 1 month,
    ### and the frass baskets were emptied every 1 month,
    ### So this flux calculated from frass basket is the biomass as well.
    ### Except for July, the life cycle is a bit longer. 
    ### Data were collected on a monthly basis, but the samplings were conducted quarterly.
