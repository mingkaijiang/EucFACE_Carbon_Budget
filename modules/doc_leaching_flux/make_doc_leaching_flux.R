    ### Information to know: 
    ### two layers (shallow and deep), with deep assumes to be 
    ### immediately above the impermeable layer (~ 35 - 75 cm)
    ### shallow depth refer to 0 - 15 cm
    ### Assumes all DOC reaching this depth are all lost from the system
    ### May add a modeling component later, because the data were collected when soils were wet!
    ### Needs a drainage number to plug in!!!!
